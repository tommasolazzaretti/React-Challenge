write a simple React calculator (adder) su that has the following 
mandatory functionalities:

- rows can be added and removed
- each row have a sign (minus or plus)
- each row can be enabled or disabled by a dedicated control button. Disabled rows must be excluded from the addition.
- The result must be updated "live" while the user is writing
Feel free to add libraries if needed.

Structure and quality of the code, are matter of evaluation

ES6+ Javascript knowledge is matter of evaluation

Look and feel of the solution is a plus
